## 问题

**User Story**

"As a user, I'd like to be able to search movies by country and see a list of movie titles. I should be able to specify a comma-separated list of countries to search multiple countries."

---

**Task**

Implement the **getMoviesByCountry** method in `src/dao/moviesDAO.js` to search movies by country and use projection to return the `title` field. The `_id` field will be returned by default.

**Hint**

Check the implementation of similar formats of search criteria - the `genres` query should be similar.

**Testing and Running the Application**

Make sure you look at the tests in `projection.test.js` to look at what is expected.

You can run the unit tests for this ticket by running:

```bash
npm test -t projection
```

Once the unit tests are passing, run the application with:

```
npm start
```

Now proceed to the [status page](http://localhost:5000/status) to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.

After passing the relevant tests, what is the validation code for **Projection**?

## 解析

```js
let cursor;
try {
  // here's the find query with query predicate and field projection
  cursor = await movies
    .find({ countries: { $in: countries } })
    .project({ title: 1 });
} catch (e) {
  console.error(`Unable to issue find command, ${e}`);
  return [];
}
```
