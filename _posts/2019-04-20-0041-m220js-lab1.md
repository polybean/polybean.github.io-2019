## 问题

**Note**: There should be a section of the `README.rst` titled "Importing Data". If you imported data into Atlas during the **README** lesson, you can skip this lesson.

Now that your Atlas cluster is configured correctly, let's populate it with some data. All the data required for MFlix is contained in the `data` directory in the handout.

The `mongorestore` command necessary to import the data is located below. Copy the command and use the Atlas SRV string to import the data (including username and password credentials).

You can retrieve this SRV string from the Atlas website:

1. Click _Connect_:

2. Then click _Connect Your Application_:

3. Then copy the SRV string to your clipboard:

emember to replace `<password>` with your own password!

Once you have the SRV string, pass it to the `--uri` parameter:

```bash
mongorestore --drop --gzip --uri mongodb+srv://m220student:m220password@<YOUR_CLUSTER_URI> data
```

A few tips when running `mongorestore`:

- The `--username` and `--password` flags cannot be used with and SRV string. Instead, the username and password should be **included** in the SRV string (i.e. `mongodb+srv://m220student:m220password@<your-cluster-address>`)
- In order to work properly, this command must be run from the top-level of the `mflix-<language>/` directory, where `<language>` is your chosen programming language.

You can verify that the data was imported by connecting to Atlas from the `mongo` shell:

```bash
mongo mongodb+srv://m220student:m220password@<YOUR_CLUSTER_URI>
```
