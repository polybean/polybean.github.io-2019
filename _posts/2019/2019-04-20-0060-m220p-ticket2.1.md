## 问题

**User Story**

"As a user, I'd like to get the next page of results for my query by scrolling down in the main window of the application."

---

**Task**

Modify the method **get_movies** in `db.py` to allow for paging. You can see how the page is parsed and sent in the **api_search_movies** method from `movies.py`.

---

**MFlix Functionality**

The UI is already asking for infinite scroll, but it's not implemented yet. Only the first 20 movies (the first "page" of movies) appear on the MFlix homepage.

Once this ticket is completed, scrolling to the bottom of the page will load the next 20 movies, or the next page of movies.

---

**Testing and Running the Application**

Make sure you look at the tests in `test_paging.py` to look at what is expected.

You can run the unit tests for this ticket by running:

```bash
pytest -m paging
```

Once the unit tests are passing, run the application with:

```
python run.py
```

Now proceed to the [status page](http://localhost:5000/status) to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.

After passing the relevant tests, what is the validation code for **Paging**?

## 解析

考察 cursor 与分页相关的方法：

- `skip`
- `limit`

Python 程序实现：

```py
  movies = cursor.limit(movies_per_page).skip(movies_per_page * page)
```

注意：`skip`与`limit`的先后顺序无关。
