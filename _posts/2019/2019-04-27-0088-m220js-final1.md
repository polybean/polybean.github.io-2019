## 问题

Assume a collection called elections that holds data about all United States Presidential Elections since 1789. All the documents in the elections collection look like this:

```json
{
  "year": 1828,
  "winner": "Andrew Jackson",
  "winner_running_mate": "John C. Calhoun",
  "winner_party": "Democratic",
  "winner_electoral_votes": 178,
  "total_electoral_votes": 261
}
```

`total_electoral_votes` represents the total number of electoral votes that year, and `winner_electoral_votes` represents the number of electoral votes received by the winning candidates.

Which of the following queries will retrieve _all_ the **Republican** winners with at least **160** electoral votes?

Choose the best answer:

```
[ ] elections.find({ winner_party: "Republican", winner_electoral_votes: { $gte: 160 }})
[ ] elections.find({ total_electoral_votes: { $gte: 160 }, winner_party: "Republican" })
[ ] elections.find({ winner_electoral_votes: { $gte: 160 }})
[ ] elections.find({ winner_party: "Republican", winner_electoral_votes: { $lt: 160 }})
[ ] elections.find({ winner_party: "Republican", winner_electoral_votes: { $lte: 160 }})
```

## 解析

查询条件需满足：

1. 获胜的是共和党：`winner_party: "Republican"`
2. 选票张数至少 160：`winner_electoral_votes: { $gte: 160 }`

## 答案

```
[X] elections.find({ winner_party: "Republican", winner_electoral_votes: { $gte: 160 }})
[ ] elections.find({ total_electoral_votes: { $gte: 160 }, winner_party: "Republican" })
[ ] elections.find({ winner_electoral_votes: { $gte: 160 }})
[ ] elections.find({ winner_party: "Republican", winner_electoral_votes: { $lt: 160 }})
[ ] elections.find({ winner_party: "Republican", winner_electoral_votes: { $lte: 160 }})
```
