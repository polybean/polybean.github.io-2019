## 问题

Suppose a client application is sending writes to a replica set with 3 nodes:

![](/assets/images/2019/m220/replica_set_primary_secondary_highlighted_ack.png)

Before returning an acknowledgement back to the client, the replica set **waits**.

What Write Concern was used in this operation?

Choose the best answer:

```
[ ] w: majority
[ ] w: 1
[ ] w: 0
[ ] w: available
```

## 解析

要求复制集中两个节点保有写操作的结果，`w`应为`2`或`majority`。

## 答案

```
[X] w: majority
[ ] w: 1
[ ] w: 0
[ ] w: available
```
