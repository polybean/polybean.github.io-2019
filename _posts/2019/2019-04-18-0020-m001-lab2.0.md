In this lab you will have to complete two different tasks:

- Create an Atlas Account
- Create Atlas Sandbox Cluster

## Creating a new MongoDB Atlas Account

If you do not have an existing Atlas account, go ahead and [create an Atlas Account](https://cloud.mongodb.com/links/registerForAtlas) by filling in the required fields:

## Creating an Atlas Sandbox Cluster

1. After creating a new account, you will be prompted to create the first cluster in that project:

2. Choose AWS as the cloud provider, in a Region that has the label **Free Tier Available**:

3. Select _Cluster Tier_ M0:

4. Set _Cluster Name_ to **Sandbox** and click "Create Cluster":

5. Once you press Create Cluster, you will be redirected to the account dashboard. In this dashboard, make sure you set your project name to **M001**. Go to Settings menu item and change the project name from the default **Project 0** to **M001**:

6. Next, configure the security settings of this cluster, by enabling the _IP Whitelist_ and _MongoDB Users_:

Update your IP Whitelist so that your app can talk to the cluster. Click the "Security" tab from the "Clusters" page. Then click "IP Whitelist" followed by "Add IP Address". Finally, click "Allow Access from Anywhere" and click "Confirm".

_Note that we do not generally recommend opening an Atlas cluster to allow access from anywhere. We do that for this class to minimize network issues that you might run into, and to be able to provide you better support_

7. Then create the application MongoDB database user required for this course:

- username: **m001-student**
- password: **m001-mongodb-basics**

You can create new users through _Security -> Add New User_.

Allow this user the privilege to **Read and write to any database**:
