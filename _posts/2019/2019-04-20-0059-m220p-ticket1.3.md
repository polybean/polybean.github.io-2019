## 问题

**User Story**

"As a user, I'd like to be able to search movies by cast members, genre, or perform a text search of the plot summary, full plot, and title."

---

**Task**

For this ticket, you will need to modify the method **build_query_sort_project** in `db.py` to allow the following movie search criteria:

- `genres`: finds all movies that match the search genres

Already, the **build_query_sort_project** method is able to return results for two different types of movie search criteria:

- `text` : performs a text search in the movies collection
- `cast`: finds movies that include any of the wanted cast

You just need to construct the query that queries the `movies` collection by genre.

A text index was created for you when you restored the collections with **mongorestore**, so these queries will be performant once they are implemented.

**Hint**

Check the implementation of similar formats of search criteria - the `genres` query should be similar.

Once you complete this ticket, the UI will allow movie searches by members of the `cast`, movie `genres`, movie `title`, and `plot` summary.

**Testing and Running the Application**

Make sure you look at the tests in `test_text_and_subfield_search.py` to look at what is expected.

You can run the unit tests for this ticket by running:

```bash
pytest -m text_and_subfield_search
```

Once the unit tests are passing, run the application with:

```py
python run.py
```

Now proceed to the [status page](http://localhost:5000/status) to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.

After passing the relevant tests, what is the validation code for **Text and Subfield Search**?
