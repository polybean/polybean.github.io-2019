## 问题

Suppose a client application is sending writes to a replica set with three nodes, but the primary node stops responding:

![](/assets/images/2019/m220/replica_set_primary_down.png)

Assume that none of the connection settings have been changed, and that the client is only sending insert statements with write concern `w: 1` to the server.

After 30 seconds, the client still cannot connect to a new primary. Which of the following errors will be thrown by the Node.js driver, and how should it be handled?

Choose the best answer:

```
[ ] a Timeout error, resolved by wrapping the call in a try/catch block
[ ] a Timeout error, resolved by restarting the database server
[ ] a Write Concern error, resolved by wrapping the call in a try/catch block
[ ] a Duplicate Key error, resolved by using a new _id in the write
[ ] a Write Concern error, resolved by reducing the durability of the write
```

## 解析

因 Replica Set 发生 Failover 而导致写操作无法成功，通过 try/catch 捕获异常。其他选项不适用的原因见答案。

## 答案

```
[X] a Timeout error, resolved by wrapping the call in a try/catch block
[ ] a Timeout error, resolved by restarting the database server（重启数据库服务器不能解决应用程序的问题）
[ ] a Write Concern error, resolved by wrapping the call in a try/catch block（w: 1是合理的设置，没有问题）
[ ] a Duplicate Key error, resolved by using a new _id in the write（写操作未必是insert，可能是update）
[ ] a Write Concern error, resolved by reducing the durability of the write（w: 1是合理的设置，没有问题，如果降低为w: 0，则是危险的行为）
```
