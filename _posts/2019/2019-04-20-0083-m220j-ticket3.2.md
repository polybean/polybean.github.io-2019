## 问题

**Task**

For this ticket, you'll be completing a script that performs field data type migrations. The script main class implementation is **src/main/java/mflix/Migrator.java**.

Things always change, and a requirement has come down that the `lastupdated` value in each document of the `movies` collection needs to be stored as an **ISODate** rather than a **String**.

Complete the script so it updates the format of lastupdated using a bulk write. You can find the exact Node.js syntax in the [docs](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.1/tutorials/crud/#bulkwrite).

To perform the migration, run the following command:

```bash
mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="mflix.Migrator"
```

or run the `Migrator.java` class from your IDE.

**Testing and Running the Application**

If the application is already running, **stop the application** and run the unit tests for this ticket by executing the following command:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=MigrationTest
```

Once the unit tests are passing, run the application with:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Or run the `Application.java` from your IDE.

Now proceed to the [status page](http://localhost:5000/status) to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.

To have the application use the changes that you implemented for this ticket, make sure to **restart the application** after you completed those changes. Also, only refresh the status page to see the new results of the tests, after the application has been restarted.

After passing the relevant tests, what is the validation code for **Migration**?
