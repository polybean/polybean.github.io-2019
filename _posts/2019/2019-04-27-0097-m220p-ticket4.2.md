## 问题

**Task**

For this ticket, you'll be required to modify the configuration of `MongoClient` to set a write timeout of 2500 milliseconds.

The MongoClient in `db.py` is initialized in the **get_db** method. A link to the [URI connection settings](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/api/pymongo/mongo_client.html) is included here for your reference.

**Testing and Running the Application**

You can run the unit tests for this ticket by running:

```bash
pytest -m timeouts
```

Once the unit tests are passing, run the application with:

```
python run.py
```

Now proceed to the status page to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.

After passing the relevant tests, what is the validation code for **Timeouts**?

## 解析

将工程文件和测试文件建立 MongoDB 连接的代码片段中都指定写操作超时为 2500 毫秒:

```py
db = g._database = MongoClient(
    MFLIX_DB_URI,
    maxPoolSize=50,
    wtimeout=2500
)["mflix"]
```
