## Question

Which of the following field names appear in documents in the movies collection of the video database. Check all that apply.

Check all answers that apply:

```
[ ] _id
[ ] cast
[ ] comments
[ ] director
[ ] genre
[ ] length
[ ] plot
[ ] stars
```

## 解析

由于 MongoDB 没有 schema，所以我们不能通过观察单个文档推知该文档所在 collection 的 schema。使用 MongoDB Compass 的 Schema 分析工具得到`video.movies` collection 中出现的所有字段。具体步骤如下：

1. 选择`video.movies`，点击"Analyze Schema"
