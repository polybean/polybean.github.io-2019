## 问题

**Task**

For this ticket, you'll be required to modify the configuration of the `MongoClient` to set the maximum size of the connection pool to **50** connections.

The MongoClient is initialized in the `src/index.js` file. A link to the [URI connection settings](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.1/reference/connecting/connection-settings/) is included here for your reference.

**Testing and Running the Application**

Note:

The unit test only has access to DAO methods, but the connection pool size for the MFlix application is set in the `index.js` file.

However, the connection pool size for the **testing** environment is set in `test/config/mongoEnvironment.js`, so you can test your changes there and the unit test will tell you if something is wrong.

When the unit test passes, make sure to update the code in `src/index.js` so you can retrieve the validation code from the integration test.

You can run the unit tests for this ticket by running:

```bash
npm test -t connection-pooling
```

Once the unit tests are passing, run the application with:

```
npm start
```

Now proceed to the status page to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.

After passing the relevant tests, what is the validation code for **Connection Pooling**?

## 解析

将工程文件和测试文件建立 MongoDB 连接的代码片段中都指定连接池大小为 50:

```js
MongoClient.connect(process.env.MFLIX_DB_URI, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  poolSize: 50
});
```
