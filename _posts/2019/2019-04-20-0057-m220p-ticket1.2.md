## 问题

**User Story**

"As a user, I'd like to be able to search movies by country and see a list of movie titles. I should be able to specify a comma-separated list of countries to search multiple countries."

---

**Task**

Implement the **get_movies_by_country** method in `db.py` to search movies by country and use projection to return the `title` field.

---

**MFlix Functionality**

Once you complete this ticket, the UI will allow movie searches by one or more countries.

---

**Testing and Running the Application**

Make sure you look at the tests in `test_projection.py` to look at what is expected.

You can run the unit tests for this ticket by running:

```bash
pytest -m projection
```

Once the unit tests are passing, run the application with:

```
python run.py
```

Now proceed to the [status page](http://localhost:5000/status) to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.

After passing the relevant tests, what is the validation code for **Projection**?
