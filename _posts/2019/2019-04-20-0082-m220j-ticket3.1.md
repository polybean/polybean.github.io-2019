## 问题

**User Story**

"As an administrator, I want to be able to view the top 20 users by their number of comments."

---

**Task**

For this ticket, you'll be required to modify the **mostActiveCommenters** method in `CommentDao.java`. This method produces a report of the 20 most frequent commenters on the MFlix site.

**Hint**

This report is meant to be run from the backend by a manager that is very particular about the accuracy of data. Ensure that the [read concern](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/read-concern/index.html) used in this read avoids any potential document rollback.

Remember to add the necessary changes in the pipeline to meet the requirements. More information can be found in the comments of the method.

---

**MFlix Functionality**

Once this ticket is completed, administrators will be able to generate a report of the top commenters on the site.

---

**Testing and Running the Application**

If the application is already running, **stop the application** and run the unit tests for this ticket by executing the following command:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=UserReportTest
```

Once the unit tests are passing, run the application with:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Or run the `Application.java` from your IDE.

Now proceed to the [status page](http://localhost:5000/status) to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.

To have the application use the changes that you implemented for this ticket, make sure to **restart the application** after you completed those changes. Also, only refresh the status page to see the new results of the tests, after the application has been restarted.

After passing the relevant tests, what is the validation code for **User Report**?

## 解析

```java
public List<Critic> mostActiveCommenters() {
    List<Critic> mostActive = new ArrayList<>();

    /**
      * In this method we can use the $sortByCount stage:
      * https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sortByCount/index.html
      * using the $email field expression.
      */
    Bson groupByCountStage = Aggregates.sortByCount("$email");
    // Let's sort descending on the `count` of comments
    Bson sortStage = Aggregates.sort(Sorts.descending("count"));
    // Given that we are required the 20 top users we have to also $limit
    // the resulting list
    Bson limitStage = Aggregates.limit(20);
    // Add the stages to a pipeline
    List<Bson> pipeline = new ArrayList<>();
    pipeline.add(groupByCountStage);
    pipeline.add(sortStage);
    pipeline.add(limitStage);

    // We cannot use the CommentDao class `commentCollection` object
    // since this returns Comment objects.
    // We need to create a new collection instance that returns
    // Critic objects instead.
    // Given that this report is required to be accurate and
    // reliable, we want to guarantee a high level of durability, by
    // ensuring that the majority of nodes in our Replica Set
    // acknowledged all documents for this query. Therefore we will be
    // setting our ReadConcern to "majority"
    // https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.readConcern/
    MongoCollection<Critic> commentCriticCollection =
            this.db.getCollection("comments", Critic.class)
                    .withCodecRegistry(this.pojoCodecRegistry)
                    .withReadConcern(ReadConcern.MAJORITY);

    // And execute the aggregation command output in our collection object.
    commentCriticCollection.aggregate(pipeline).into(mostActive);
    return mostActive;
}
```
